RAG Q&A Chatbot with OpenAI and FAISS

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using:
- OpenAI's GPT (via API)
- Sentence Transformers for embedding
- FAISS for fast similarity search
- A CSV-based knowledge base (e.g., loan prediction data)

It allows users to ask natural language questions and get contextual answers generated based on relevant documents retrieved from the dataset.
